AIM

To write a C++ program that represents a graph using an adjacency list and displays the connections of each node.

ALGORITHM
1.Start.
2.Include the necessary header files.
3.Ask the user for the number of vertices and edges.
4.Create a vector of lists to represent the adjacency list.
5.For each edge, take two vertices u and v.
6.Insert v into the adjacency list of u (and u into the list of v for an undirected graph).
7.After input, print the adjacency list.
8.End.

CODE
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int vertices, edges;
    cout << "Enter number of vertices: ";
    cin >> vertices;

    cout << "Enter number of edges: ";
    cin >> edges;

    // Create adjacency list
    vector<vector<int>> graph(vertices);

    cout << "Enter edges (u v):" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < edges; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;

        // Add edge (undirected graph)
        graph[u].push_back(v);
        graph[v].push_back(u);
    }

    cout << "\nAdjacency List Representation:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        cout << i << " -> ";
        for (int node : graph[i]) {
            cout << node << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT (Example)

If the input is:

Enter number of vertices: 4
Enter number of edges: 3
Enter edges (u v):
0 1
1 2
2 3


Output:

Adjacency List Representation:
0 -> 1
1 -> 0 2
2 -> 1 3
3 -> 2

RESULT

The program successfully demonstrates a basic graph concept in C++
