Experiment No: 2
AIM:
To illustrate the concept of Classes and Objects in C++ by implementing
member functions defined both inside and outside the class using a Car example.
--------------------------------------------
ALGORITHM:
1. Start the program.
2. Define a class named 'Car' with data members: brand, model, and year.
3. Define a member function 'getData()' inside the class to input details.
4. Declare another member function 'display()' inside the class but define it outside.
5. In main(), create an object of the class Car.
6. Call getData() and display() using the object.
7. Display the car details and stop the program.
--------------------------------------------
CODE:
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
private:
    string brand;
    string model;
    int year;

public:
    // Member function defined inside the class
    void getData() {
        cout << "Enter Car Brand: ";
        cin >> brand;
        cout << "Enter Car Model: ";
        cin >> model;
        cout << "Enter Manufacturing Year: ";
        cin >> year;
    }

    // Member function declared inside but defined outside the class
    void display();
};

// Member function defined outside the class using scope resolution operator
void Car::display() {
    cout << "\nCar Details:\n";
    cout << "Brand: " << brand << endl;
    cout << "Model: " << model << endl;
    cout << "Year: " << year << endl;
}

int main() {
    Car c;
    c.getData();
    c.display();
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
Enter Car Brand: Toyota
Enter Car Model: Fortuner
Enter Manufacturing Year: 2022

Car Details:
Brand: Toyota
Model: Fortuner
Year: 2022
--------------------------------------------
RESULT:
Thus, the program to illustrate the concept of classes and objects with
member functions defined both inside and outside the class was executed successfully.
