Aim:
To implement file handling in cpp
----------------------------------------------------
Algorithm:
1:Start the program.
2:Include the header file <iostream> and <fstream>.
3:Use the std namespace.
4:Create an object of the ofstream class to write data into a file.
5:Open a file and write some content to it.
6:Close the file after writing.
7:Create an object of the ifstream class to read data from the file.
8:Open the same file and display its content on the screen.
9:Close the file.
10:Stop the program.
----------------------------------------------------
Code:
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Writing to a file
    ofstream outfile("sample.txt");  // create and open file
    outfile << "Hello, this is a file handling example in C++!" << endl;
    outfile.close();  // close file after writing

    // Reading from the file
    ifstream infile("sample.txt");
    string line;
    cout << "Content of the file:" << endl;
    while (getline(infile, line)) {
        cout << line << endl;
    }
    infile.close();  // close file after reading

    return 0;
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Output:
Content of the file:
Hello, this is a file handling example in C++!

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
the program to implement File Handling in C++ was successfully executed.
